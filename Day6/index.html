      <h1>Example Cafe Recipes World's Best Scrambles Eggs</h1>
      <p>
        I adapted this recipe from a book called <i><u>Sydnay Food</u></i> by Bill Grainger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to bill's restaurant in Kings Cross, Sydnet. I have been after the recipe. I have since transformed it int when i really believe are the best scrambled eggs i have ever tasted.<br>

        This recipe is wheat i call a "very special breakfast;" just look at the ingredients the see why. it has to be tasted to be believed.
